# About
Synth Data Generator is an application created, initially as a library, and then with the addition of the json file builder, as a way to test creating fake log files or text files. There was a need to create files with different content to simulate log file data and this is the start of the effort.

# Future
The generator application is very static. In the future meta data files will be used to define what content is generated by synth_library. Additionally the complexity of the application will be reduced....After having learned a fair amount of Rust since I started this project, improvements are necessary.

# Todo
* Continue building out the logging component of the application
* Implement generic data builder based on config files

# Usage

To run the application with the default data sets use the below command
```
cargo run --release --bin generator -- --output-dst file
```

## Building
To build from source either run
```
cargo build --release
```
or use the included build_releases.sh script for both Debian and redhat releases.

I have not built for windows but I suspect it shouldn't be difficult, there is no complicated libraries included.
